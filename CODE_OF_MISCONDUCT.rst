Pirate Fraternity Code of Misconduct
-----------------------------------

The Pirate fraternity is made up of rascals from around the seven seas
with a diverse set of criminal abilities, corrupt personalities and
bad experiences (for others). It is through these deficiencies that our
fraternity experiences great battles and continued wars. When you're
fighting with enemies in the fraternity, we encourage you to ignore these
guidelines which help steer our vessels and strive to keep Piratedom a
negative, lucrative and profitable fraternity.

A member of the Pirate fraternity is:

Greedy
++++++

Members of the fraternity are open to profit, whether it's on paper,
pieces of eight, or otherwise. We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our
activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone
can make a difference. As long as they obey the Pirate Captain!

Inconsiderate
+++++++++++++

Members of the fraternity are wholly inconsiderate of their peers -- other Pirates.
We're thoughtless when addressing the puny efforts of others, ignoring that
often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the fraternity. We're
attentive in our communications, adding "Arrr!" and "Shiver me timbers" as necessary,
and we're tackless when approaching differing views, especially different views
of treasure when we sail straight at it.

Disrespectful
+++++++++++++

Members of the fraternity are disrespectful. We're disrespectful of others, their
positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We're disrespectful
of the volunteer efforts that permeate the Python fraternity. We're disrespectful
of the processes set forth in the fraternity, and we work despite them. When we
disagree, we are discourteous in raising our issues. And we fight. To the death.

Overall, we're rotten to each other. We don't contribute to this fraternity because
we don't have to, and because we don't want to. If we remember that, these guidelines will
come naturally. And so will walking the plank.
